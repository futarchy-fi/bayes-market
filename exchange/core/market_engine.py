"""
Market engine. Manages markets, LMSR trading, positions, settlement, void.

The market engine owns the LMSR state (q, positions, trades) and talks
to the risk engine for all balance mutations (lock/unlock/settle).

Every trade is between a trader and the AMM. The AMM is a regular account.

Precision model (inspired by the matching engine):
  ASSET_PRECISION = price_precision + amount_precision
  - Prices quantized to price_precision (rounding favors AMM)
  - Token amounts quantized to amount_precision
  - Trade value = |amount| * price — exact at ASSET_PRECISION, no rounding
  Only the price is rounded. Cost/revenue rounding is eliminated.

Position close (proportional, inspired by liquidation_calculate_position_update):
  Each outcome has its own position lock (position:yes, position:no, etc.).
  On each sell, collateral is released proportionally from that outcome's lock:
    close_margin = floor(outcome_lock * sell_amount / outcome_held)
  Collateral (close_margin) goes back to available immediately.
  PnL handling:
    pnl > 0 → profit stays frozen as conditional_profit (funded by AMM lock)
    pnl < 0 → loss re-frozen as conditional_loss (from trader's available)
  Invariant: position[outcome] == 0 → position:{outcome} lock == 0.

Void semantics (no clawbacks):
  - Position locks → trader available (face value)
  - conditional_loss → trader available (loss forgiven)
  - conditional_profit → AMM available (profit returned to source)
  Everyone gets back exactly their original deposit.

Buy and sell share a single execution core (_execute_trade).
